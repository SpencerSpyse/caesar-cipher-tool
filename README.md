# 🔐 Caesar Cipher & Brute Force Tool

## 📄 Description
A Python-based cybersecurity tool that demonstrates classical encryption and cryptanalysis techniques. This project implements the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm to encrypt and decrypt sensitive text. It also includes a **Brute Force** module capable of cracking messages without a key by analyzing all 25 possible shifts.

## ✨ Features
* **Encryption:** Secure messages by shifting characters based on a user-defined key.
* **Decryption:** Decode messages when the key is known.
* **Brute Force Attack:** Automatically generate all possible plaintexts to "hack" a message when the key is unknown.
* **Input Validation:** Handles uppercase, lowercase, and preserves special characters.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/caesar-cipher-tool.git](https://github.com/SpencerSpyse/caesar-cipher-tool.git)
    ```
3.  Navigate to the directory and run the script:
    ```bash
    python cipher.py
    ```
4.  Follow the on-screen menu to select your mode (Encrypt, Decrypt, or Brute Force).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This tool is for educational purposes only. It is designed to demonstrate how classical ciphers work and why they are vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
